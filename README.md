This repository contains assignments of the course cs231n Deep Learning for Computer Vision at Stanford. Assignments are taken from here: https://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments.html.
I found this interesting as it'll improve my theoretical and practical understanding of deep learning techniques by implementing everything from scratch. Below are the details about each assignment:

### Assignment 1: Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully-Connected Neural Network

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages).
- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
- Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy.
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier.
- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier.
- Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier.
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers.
- Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, etc.
